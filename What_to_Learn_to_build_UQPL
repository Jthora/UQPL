Symbolic AI focuses on representing knowledge through symbols and logical rules rather than through statistical patterns. It's a branch of AI that aims to mimic human-like reasoning using structured symbols.

- **Rule-Based Systems**: These systems represent knowledge in the form of **if-then rules**. For example:
  - *If* the input is a **cat**, *then* the output is a **pet**. 
  - Learn about how rules can be used to guide decision-making processes in AI.
  - Study systems such as **expert systems**, which use rule-based reasoning to solve complex problems within specialized domains (e.g., **medical diagnosis systems**).
